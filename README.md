Goals of the lab

    Course application

    Data sctructures

    Python Object Oriented Programming

Unless specified otherwise, all the programs are expected to be completed in Python or O’caml.

    Graph representations:

        Implement a class for sparse graphs;

        Implement a class for dense graphs;

In each case implement at least the following methods:

    • AddEdge
    	

    • RemoveVertex
    	

    • SetEdgeWeight

    • RemoveEdge
    	

    • IsAdjacent1
    	

    • GetVertexValue

    • AddVertex
    	

    • GetEdgeWeight
    	

    • SetVertexValue

    Implement Dijkstra algorithm (3.??) using Fibonacci heaps;

    Bellman-Ford (algorithm 3.??);

    Compare the efficiency of Bellman-Ford and Dijkstra in terms of (i) complexity and (ii) running time;

1v.IsAdjacent(u) checks if vertices v and u are adjacent.
